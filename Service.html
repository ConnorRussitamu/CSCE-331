        <h1>Service</h1>
        <h2>Grace SouthWood</h2>
        <p>I volunteer at Grace SouthWood Church in College Station, TX. I help with the 5th and 6th graders as one of the leaders in the room.
            I help lead games, discussions, and activities with the kids. I have been volunteering here for about 9 months every sunday morning.
            I love the community and the kids are so amazing. I love being able to help lead them and be a positive influence in their lives.
        </p>
        <h2>Student Bonfire</h2>
        <p>I volunteer my time here as one of the mech pots. I work as a head fleet mechanic leading the maintience and repairs on Bonfire's fleet of 
            trucks, trailers and tractors ensuring they are in top working condition for bonfire events. I am in charge of also making sure clients
            are satisfied with the timeframe in which their vehicles are repaired. I also have to ensure that non-technical clients understand the issues
            and potential fixes in order to make informed decisions based on their needs and budget. I love getting to work on a team of qualified individuals
            and learning about the intracacies of managing a fleet of vehicles. I love getting to work with my hands and give back to an organization that has
            given so much to Texas A&M. I was exccited to see that the vehicles I work on were able to be used to help after the recent floods in Kerr county TX.
            I am proud to be a part of an organization that gives back to the community in such a meaningful way stepping up to help even when not required.

        <h2>Off Campus Aggies</h2>
        <p>I led a team of 50+ volunteers working as the Yellow pot or head supervisor of the off campus crew. This is one of 12 crews based on different dorms
            around campus. We take care of off campus students providing them a community, bringing together students of all ages and backgrounds to partake in 
            one of A&M's most beloved traditions. I led a team of 5 crew cheifs who then managed the rest of the crew, delegating tasks and ensuring everything ran smoothly.
            I oversaw the recruiting, tool maintenance, safety, fundraising, event coordination, and marketing for the crew. I 
            loved getting to learn about leadership and give back to the university that has given me so much.
