        <p>Welcome to my technical portfolio. Here are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>
        
        <h2>Saloon Simulator: Self-Directed VR Game built on Unity in C# for Oculus Quest</h2>
        <p>A VR game developed on the Unity Engine using C# with a focus on utliizing object-oriented programming principles.
            The game is currently in developement and will be available on the Oculus Store upon completion. As of fall 2025 the game is 
            in playtesting phase with plans to release a demo in mid 2026 and a full release in late 2026. 
            The game is a first person game where the player takes on the role of a bartender in a wild west saloon.
            The player must prepare drinks quickly and accurately to keep the customers happy and earn money to buy upgrades or toys for the bar. 
            Unhappy patrons will start to shoot at the player leading to a gun fight while still trying to serve over guests.
