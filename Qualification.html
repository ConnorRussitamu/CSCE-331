        <h2>Technical Areas of Interest</h2>
        <p> I am particuarly interested in Object-Oriented Programming. I think it is super faciniating and interesting to understand how it works and how one 
            could better utilize it to create better software. I have used OOP in class previouslt and in personally projects unintentionally and have been
            impressed with how well it works when I use it intentionally. I am very interested in AI-driven coding and the strengths and weaknesses of AI. 
            I think it is impressive and very intersting to understand how AI works and AI's strengths and weaknesses.
